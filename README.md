## Introduction

The goal of this workshop is to introduce the AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) and the WAF Security Automations Solution. 

The AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) enables customers to create rules to block common attack patterns, administered via APIs. 
The Security Automation Solution extends WAF by deploying a set of preconfigured rules to protect applications. These rules can be customised for your application.

## Learning Objectives

* Understand the functionality provided by WAF
* Understand how the Security Automation Solution extends WAF
* Understand how to configure the Security Automation Solution

## Prerequisites

To complete this workshop you will require the following:
* An AWS Account. 
    * If you donâ€™t already have an AWS account, create one at <https://aws.amazon.com> by following the on-screen instructions
* Your access to the AWS account must have IAM permissions to launch AWS CloudFormation templates that create IAM roles.
